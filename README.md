Given starter code, create the backend Javascript for a password generator

## Description
I created JS code to generate a password given user inputs for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. The user initally will input a number between 8 and 128 if this is not satisfied it will return invalid input. If the user says no to all character types it will say no character types have been selected.

The code was created using a series of if else conditional statements for each possible scenario. Arrays were made for each possible value and using the math methods to randomize the selection of characters in order to push into a new array. Once created the array was then made to a string and commas were removed before returning to the user.
